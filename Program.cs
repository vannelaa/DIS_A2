        Given a string paragraph and a string array of the banned words banned, return the most frequent word that is not banned. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that is not banned, and that the answer is unique.

        You are trying to write s across several lines, where each line is no longer than 100 pixels. Starting at the beginning of s, write as many letters on the first line such that the total width does not exceed 100 pixels.

         Question 8
        International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows:
        •	'a' maps to ".-",
        •	'b' maps to "-...",
        •	'c' maps to "-.-.", and so on.
        For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:
        [".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
        Given an array of strings words where each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter.
            •	For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", which is the concatenation of "-.-.", ".-", and "-...". We will call such a concatenation the transformation of a word.
        Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.
 
        Example 1:

        "gig" -> "--...--."

You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most t. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.
